  "start-msg": "Welcome to Flashcards Bot!\n\nI'm here to help you learn effectively using the spaced repetition method. This method is based on a simple idea: the closer to the moment of forgetting, the better you remember information.\n\n🔗 How to get started:\n1. Add a new flashcard using the 'Add Card' command.  \n2. I'll calculate when you need to review the flashcard; all you have to do is press 'Review'\n\n💬 At any time, you can press the 'Help' button to get a detailed description of all functions. By clicking on 'Settings' you can edit your cards or customize reminders.\n\nGood luck with your studies!",
